          <h2>Privacy Policy:</h2><p>investigative-reports.net (&quot;<strong>Investigative Reports </strong>&quot;) operates Investigative Reports and may operate other websites. It is Investigative Reports policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Investigative Reports collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Investigative Reports purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Investigative Reports visitors use its website. From time to time, Investigative Reports may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Investigative Reports also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Investigative Reports blogs/sites. Investigative Reports only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Investigative Reports websites choose to interact with Investigative Reports in ways that require Investigative Reports to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Investigative Reports gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a href="http://investigative-reports.net">Investigative Reports </a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Investigative Reports are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Investigative Reports collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Investigative Reports . Investigative Reports does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
